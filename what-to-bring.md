#Wardrobe Advice

September is a beautiful month in Santa Cruz, with sunny warm days and comfortably cool evenings with little fog compared to other times of year. By the water, temperatures will sit mostly in the 60s and 70s, with the coolest temperatures in the mid-50s and the warmest temperatures in the mid-80s.  The temperature of Monterey Bay is a "refreshing" 60 degrees F, but the pool at the Dream Inn will be much warmer, if you are thinking of swimming.  The dress in Santa Cruz is "laid-back surfer," and you should feel comfortable walking around town with jeans, shorts, flip flops, and sweatshirts (called "hoodies" by the locals).  Here are a couple suggestions regarding each of our weekend events:

##Friday, September 12:
We will have a festive evening of dinner and music in downtown Santa Cruz starting at 6:30pm (location has been emailed to attendees).  Please wear something fun and festive! Gentlemen, we suggest you wear slacks and a button-down shirt (jacket or sports jacket and tie are optional). Since our wedding the next day will be a non-high heels affair, ladies this is your chance to wear your favorite pair if you would like. Bring a sweater if you plan on walking back to the hotel at night.

##Saturday, September 13:
On Saturday afternoon, we will have our wedding ceremony followed by dinner and dancing (location and directions on wedding invitation).  It will be warm (probably in the 80s) when you arrive at our wedding site in Bonny Doon (in the mountains) around 4pm. It will get cooler as the sun goes down, with a possibility of fog rolling in, but we will have heat lamps, wine, and dancing to keep you toasty.  This is not a black tie event, but we will have an elegant ceremony in a fruit orchard with dinner and dancing under the stars.  Gentlemen, please wear a suit and tie. Ladies, the attire is elegant, but not formal; please plan to wear flats or wedges, as we will be on the grass for most of the evening. Please plan to bring a layer or two as it will get cooler as the sun goes down.

##Sunday, September 14:
On Sunday from 11am-1pm, we will have a casual farewell brunch (location has been emailed to attendees).
