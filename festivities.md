Weekend Festivities!
====================

Our wedding festivities will begin with an evening of dinner and live music at a venue in downtown Santa Cruz on the evening of **Friday, September 12**. Location details and directions will be emailed to attendees.

On **Saturday, September 13**, we ask that you arrive at our wedding site in Bonny Doon at 4pm for our wedding ceremony. A cocktail hour, dinner, and dancing will follow. Our wedding invitation provides location details and driving directions to the wedding site (25-30 minutes from our hotels), and we will provide shuttles to and from the Dream Inn and Sea & Sand Inn (time TBA) for those who would prefer not to drive themselves.

We will have a casual brunch the morning of **Sunday, September 14** for those guests who wish to stop by and wish the happy couple off on their honeymoon! Location details will be emailed to attendees.

If you are booking plane flights or driving to Santa Cruz, we recommend arriving Friday early afternoon and booking a hotel room for both 9/12 and 9/13. [See details on travel and hotels.](travel-and-hotels.html#site)
