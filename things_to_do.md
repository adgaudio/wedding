Things to Do in Santa Cruz!
============

In case we aren't keeping you busy enough during your stay in Santa Cruz, here is a list of some of our favorite fun and local things to do and experience!


Walking, Running, and Biking
----------------
- [West Cliff Drive](http://hilltromper.com/article/west-cliff-drive):
  Exit out of the Dream Inn and Sea & Sand Inn and walk to your left (or right if you are at The Darling House) on the walking/bike path. Walk to the lighthouse and see the surfers and sea lions or walk even further (the whole trail is about 4 miles roundtrip).

- [Wilder Ranch State Park](http://hilltromper.com/article/wilder-ranch):
  Explore the preserved ranch buildings and seaside trail. Wilder Ranch is about a mile north of Santa Cruz on Highway 1.

- [Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park]http://hilltromper.com/article/henry-cowell):
  Drive 20 minutes inland from Santa Cruz into the Santa Cruz Mountains and walk amongst the giant redwood trees!

Beaches and Tidepools

- [Cowells Beach](http://hilltromper.com/article/cowells)
  The closest beach to the hotels right in front of the Dream Inn.
