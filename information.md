California here we come!
=====

The beautiful city of Santa Cruz is located 1 hour and 15 miutes from San Francisco and 30 minutes from San Jose.  There is no easily accessible public transportation from the airports, so we suggest renting a car or taking the Super Shuttle. The beach and downtown Santa Cruz are within walking distance from the hotels, so unless you are planning on doing other site-seeing, you do not necessarily need a car. We will provide transportation to and from hotels to the wedding location on September 13.


Nearest Airports
-----
- SFO (San Francisco International Airport)
    - This is the biggest airport with the most non-stop flights
- SJC (San Jose International Airport)
    - Although closer to Santa Cruz, there are less flight options
