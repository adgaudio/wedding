The Special Story Behind our Wedding Invitations
=======

This June, we spent 4 blissful days letterpress printing our wedding invitations at the studio of master printmaker, poet, and good friend Gary Young.

The invitations were printed letterpress from magnesium photoengravings on an 1888 Chandler & Price treadle-powered platen press. The press was powered by foot, fed by hand, and the invitations required seven separate press runs.

Every invite features a print of a ink drawing done by Carla B. Gaudio (Alex's mom). The paper is Rives BFK, a fine French printmaking sheet.

We all took turns wearing the pressman's hat, a paper hat style worn by press operators as early as 1748.

All in all, this was a very personal and special experience that we will remember for years to come.
