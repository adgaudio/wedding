The Special Story Behind our Wedding Invitations
=======

In June, we spent 4 blissful days at the Greenhouse Review Press in Bonny Doon, CA letterpress printing our wedding inviations under the mentorship of master printmaker, poet, and good friend Gary Young.

Every invite features a print of a drawing done by Carla Gaudio (Alex's mom). 


All in all, this was a very personal and special experience that we will remember for years to come.
