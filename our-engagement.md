Our Story!
============

Last May, after 5 1/2 wonderful years together, navigating the Bard experience, the exciting and stressful post-college period of job, apartment, and soul searching, culinary and world adventures, and the non-stop life of two 20-somethings in New York City, Emma came home from a particularly exhausting week at work to something unexpected.

Alex: "Surprise! We're going on vacation!" <br>
Emma: "What?" <br>
Alex: "Yes, we leave tonight at midnight! We're going scuba diving in Bonaire!" <br>
Emma (nervously): "Huh? Do we have to go? Where's Bonaire?" <br>
Alex: "The Caribbean" <br>
Emma: "Are you sure we have to go? I have to go to work..." <br>

Well, that wasn't exactly true, since Alex had secretly run his plot by Emma's co-workers, and they already expected her to be out of the office for a week. In fact, Alex had spilled some or all of the beans to almost everyone (his co-workers, both sets of parents, friends, family members) in order to keep the secret from Emma for 5 months. He had even convinced her to take scuba diving classes, and despite keeping his email inbox very secret and staying up late every night, he succceed in springing the surprise!

Of course Emma warmed up to the idea, and by midnight they were boarding a plane at Newark Aiport for Bonaire.

They arrived to thick, sweaty air, an airid landscape, and stunning turquoise water. After an hour's nap, it was time for Emma to meet her Dive Master to complete her coursework. Two days into the trip, Emma had been on 4 dives and gotten her Open Water Diver certification. Alex and Emma could now dive completely on their own!

They drove a white pick-up truck around the island, pulling up on beaches, gearing up and diving into the surf. The diving was perfect: 80 degree F water temperatures, excellent visibility, and brightly colored corals and fish at depths as little as 30 feet. They picked up lunches at the local supermarket, amongst the island natives who spoke English, Dutch, and Papiamentu (local creole language). At night, they walked along the water to find a place to eat, and despite the endless onslaught of mosquitos, relaxed to the rhythm of island life.

Halfway through the trip, Alex had scheduled a night dive. Rightly so, Emma was nervous about diving at night with only a flashlight in hand. He assured her they would see fish hunting and many exciting sights you couldn't see during the day. She didn't want to disappoint him, so she nervously agreed.

They waded into the water with the Dive Master at sunset and agreed on their dive plan.  Alex had his two dive lights (that he had modified using parts he printed on his homemade 3-D printer back in New York) at the ready. They descended into the darkness and began to swim along.

Emma was so nervous she followed the Dive Master's fins closely and clenched Alex's hand as they swam along. As the dive progressed, she relaxed a little, but never let go of his hand.  As discussed, they made a stop on a sandbed and turned off their dive lights.  As their eyes adjusted to the pitch black, the lights and colors of the bioluminescent plankton floating all around them began to pop out from the darkness like a shower of fireworks.

As the Dive Master began to swim away, and Emma turned to follow, Alex knew this was his moment. He removed his prepared (laminated) message from his vest pocket, a plastic ring he had printed on his 3-D printer, and a black light, and thrust the objects in front of Emma.

As the black light revealed the message (written in invisble ink), Emma read:

<i>"Dear Bubba, will you marry me?"</i>

The night dive was overwhelming enough, but this really put Emma, the new diver, to the test! Luckily, she did not shoot to the surface or stop breathing! She looked at the message and at Alex's magnified eyes through his mask, and motioned with her hand "ok" "ok" "ok" (and gave him a face that said, this is great, but can we get out of here now?)!

They spent the next few days diving (only during the day!) and adjusting to their newly engaged status (and seemingly awkward terms like "fiance" -- they prefer to say, my "beyonce").

And that is the end of the fish's tale of how Emma and Alex were engaged under the sea!
